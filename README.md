## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/)+
* [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) (install with `pip install pipenv`)

1. **📥 Clone and navigate:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dokson/hedge-fund-tracker.git
   cd hedge-fund-tracker
   ```

2. **📲 Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project root and run the following command. This will create a virtual environment and install all required packages.

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

    > **💡 Tip:** If `pipenv` is not found, you might need to use `python -m pipenv install`. This can happen if the user scripts directory is not in your system's PATH.

3. **🛠️ Configure environment:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your keys (Finnhub and Google API)

    ```bash
   # Create environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file and add your API keys:
   # FINNHUB_API_KEY="your_finnhub_key"
   # GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
   # GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
   # GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
   # HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token"
   # OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
   ```

4. **▶️ Run the script:** Execute within the project's virtual environment:

    ```bash
    pipenv run python -m app.main
    ```

5. **📜 Choose an action:** Once the script starts, you'll see the main interactive menu for data analysis:

    ```txt

    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ```

### Data Management

The data update operations (downloading and processing filings) are inside a dedicated script. This keeps the main application focused on analysis, while the updater handles populating and refreshing the database.

To run the data update operations, you need to use the `updater.py` script from the project root:

```bash
pipenv run python -m database.updater
```

### Database Updater

The `updater.py` script includes semi-automated maintenance tasks:

* **Sorting**: Upon exit (option `0`), the script automatically sorts the `database/stocks.csv` file by ticker to maintain performance and prevent Git diff noise.
* **Auto-Documentation**: This README's excluded funds section is synchronized whenever the database is refreshed manually.

This will open a separate menu for data management:

```txt

### GICS Classification

The project includes an **autonomous GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) parser** (`database/gics/updater.py`). Originally developed by [MSCI](https://www.msci.com/) and [S&P](https://www.spglobal.com/), it scrapes Wikipedia to build a full hierarchy of 163 sub-industries. This provides the AI Analyst with granular industry context while remaining independent of third-party libraries.

### API Configuration

The tool can utilize API keys for enhanced functionality, but all are optional:

| Service | Purpose | Get Free API Key |
| --------- | --------- | ------------- |

> **💡 Note:** Ticker resolution primarily uses [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), which is free and requires no API key. If that fails, the system falls back to [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) (if an API key is provided), with the final fallback being [FinanceDatabase](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/).
>
> **💡 Note:** You don't need to use all the APIs. For the generative AI models ([Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models), [Groq AI](https://console.groq.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models), and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)), you only need the API keys for the services you plan to use.
> For instance, if you want to experiment with models like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) [GPT-4o mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini), you just need a [GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Experimenting with different models is encouraged, as the quality of AI-generated analysis, both for identifying promising stocks and for conducting due diligence, can vary. However, top-performing stocks are typically identified consistently across all tested models. **All APIs used in this project are currently free (with GitHub Models providing a generous free tier for developers).**

## 👨🏻‍💻 How This Tool Tracks Hedge Funds

This tracker leverages the following types of SEC filings to provide a comprehensive view of institutional activity.

* **📅 Quarterly 13F Filings**
  * Required for funds managing $100M+
  * Filed ***within 45 days*** of quarter-end
  * Shows ***portfolio snapshot*** on last day of quarter

* **📝 Non-Quarterly 13D/G Filings**
  * Required when acquiring 5%+ of company shares
  * Filed ***within 10 days*** of the transaction
  * Provides a ***timely view*** of significant investments

* **✍🏻 Non-Quarterly SEC Form 4 Insider Filings**
  * Filed by insiders (executives, directors) or large shareholders (>10%) when they trade company stocks
  * Must be filed ***within 2 business days*** of the transaction
  * Offers ***real-time insight*** into the actions of key individuals and institutions

## 🏢 Hedge Funds Selection

This tool tracks a curated list of **what I found to be the top-performing institutional investors that file with the U.S. SEC**, *identified* based on their performance over the last 3-5 years. This **curation** is the result of my own **methodology** designed to identify the **top percentile of global investment funds**. My *selection methodology* is detailed below.

### Selection Methodology

[Modern portfolio theory (MPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) offers many methods for quantifying the [risk-return trade-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93return_spectrum), but they are often ill-suited for analyzing the limited data available in public filings. Consequently, the `hedge_funds.csv` was therefore generated using my own custom *selection algorithm* designed to identify top-performing funds while managing for [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)).

> **Note**: The selection algorithm is external to this project and was used only to produce the curated `hedge_funds.csv` list.

My approach prioritizes high [cumulative returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return) but also analyzes the path taken to achieve them: it penalizes [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), similar to the [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio), but this penalty is dynamically adjusted based on performance consistency; likewise, [drawdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawdown_(economics)) are penalized, echoing the principle of the [Sterling Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_ratio), but the penalty is intentionally dampened to avoid overly punishing funds that recover effectively from temporary downturns.

### List Management

The list of hedge funds is actively managed to maintain its quality; funds that underperform may be replaced, while new top performers are periodically added.

However, despite their strong performance, several funds with portfolios predominantly focused on **Healthcare** and **Biotech**, such as **[Nextech Invest](https://www.nextechinvest.com/)**, **[Enavate Sciences](https://enavatesciences.com/)**, **[Caligan Partners](https://www.caliganpartners.com/)**, and **[Boxer Capital Management](https://www.boxercap.com/)**, have been intentionally excluded. These funds invest in highly specialized sectors where I lack the necessary expertise. Consequently, I consider them too risky for my personal investment profile, given the complexity and volatility inherent in biotech and healthcare ventures.

#### Notable Exclusions

The quality of the output analysis is directly tied to the quality of the input data. To enhance the accuracy of the insights and opportunities identified, many popular high-profile funds have been intentionally excluded by design (the list below is automatically managed and capped to 50 funds, but you can see the full list in `excluded_hedge_funds.csv`):

<!-- EXCLUDED_FUNDS_LIST_END -->

> **💡 Note**: For convenience, key information for these funds, including their CIKs, is maintained in the `database/excluded_hedge_funds.csv` file.

#### Adding Custom Funds

Want to track additional funds? Simply edit `database/hedge_funds.csv` and add your preferred institutional investors. For example, to add [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/), [Pershing Square](https://pershingsquareholdings.com/) and [ARK-Invest](https://www.ark-invest.com/), you would add the following lines:

```csv
"CIK","Fund","Manager","Denomination","CIKs"
...
"0001067983","Berkshire Hathaway","Warren Buffett","Berkshire Hathaway Inc",""
"0001336528","Pershing Square","Bill Ackman","Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P.",""
"0001697748","ARK Invest","Cathie Wood","ARK Investment Management LLC",""
```

> **💡 Note**: `hedge_funds.csv` currently includes **not only *traditional hedge funds*** but also **other institutional investors** *(private equity funds, large banks, VCs, pension funds, etc., that file 13F to the [SEC](http://sec.gov/))* selected from what I consider the **top 5%** of performers.
>
> If you wish to track any of the **Notable Exclusions** hedge funds, you can copy the relevant rows from `excluded_hedge_funds.csv` into `hedge_funds.csv`.
>
> **Columns for Custom Funds:**

> * **`Denomination`**: This is the exact legal name used by the fund in its filings. It is **essential** for accurately processing non-quarterly filings (13D/G, Form 4) as the scraper uses it to identify the fund's specific transactions within complex filing documents.
> * **`CIKs`**: A comma-separated list of additional CIKs. This field is used to track filings from related entities or subsidiaries. Some investment firms have complex structures where different legal entities file separately (e.g., a management company and a holding company).
>   * *Example:* [Jeffrey Ubben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_W._Ubben)'s `ValueAct Holdings` (`CIK` = `0001418814`) also has filings under `ValueAct Capital Management` (`CIK` = `0001418812`). By adding `0001418812` to the `CIKs` column, the tool aggregates **non-quarterly filings** from both entities for a complete view.

## 🧠 AI Models Selection

The **AI Financial Analyst**'s primary goal is to identify stocks with the highest growth potential based on hedge fund activity. It achieves this by calculating a **"Promise Score"** for each stock. This score is a weighted average of various metrics derived from 13F filings. The AI's first critical task is to act as a strategist, dynamically defining the heuristic by assigning the optimal weights for these metrics based on the market conditions of the selected quarter. Its second task is to provide quantitative scores (e.g., momentum, risk) for the top-ranked stocks.

The models included in `database/models.csv` have been selected because they have demonstrated the best performance and reliability for these specific tasks. Through experimentation, they have proven effective at interpreting the prompts and providing insightful, well-structured responses.

> **💡 Note** on Meta's [`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_3/MODEL_CARD.md): while it can occasionally be less precise in defining the heuristic for the "Promise Score" compared to other top-tier models, it remains a valuable option. Its exceptional speed and lightweight nature make it ideal for rapid experimentation and iterative analysis, providing a useful trade-off between accuracy and performance. As the AI landscape evolves, it is expected that this model will eventually be replaced by newer alternatives that offer similar or better speed and efficiency.

> **💡 Note** on [xAI's Grok-3](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3): This tool now supports [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models), which provides access to **Grok-3** and other next-generation models like **GPT-5** and **Llama 4**. This integration allows for state-of-the-art financial reasoning and due diligence directly through your GitHub account.
>
> **💡 Note** on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/): OpenRouter was initially included because it offered free access to top-tier models; while some are no longer free, you can still use it with this tool if you have an existing API key.

### Adding Custom AI Models

You can easily add or change the AI models used for analysis by editing the `database/models.csv` file. This allows you to experiment with different Large Language Models (LLMs) from supported providers.

To add a new model, open `database/models.csv` and add a new row with the following columns:

* **ID**: The specific model identifier as required by the provider's API.
* **Description**: A brief, user-friendly description that will be displayed in the selection menu.
* **Client**: The provider of the model. Must be one of `GitHub`, `Google`, `Groq`, `HuggingFace`, or `OpenRouter`.

Here are the official model lists for each provider:

* [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models)
* [Google Gemini Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)
* [Groq Models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
* [HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/models)
* [OpenRouter Free Models](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest&max_price=0)

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

It's crucial to understand the inherent limitations of tracking investment strategies solely through SEC filings:

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| **🕒 Filing Delay** | Data can be 45+ days old | Focus on long-term strategies |
| **🧩 Incomplete Picture** | Only US long positions shown | Use as part of broader analysis |
| **📉 No Short Positions** | Missing hedge information | Consider reported positions carefully |
| **🌎 Limited Scope** | No non-US stocks or other assets | Supplement with additional data |

### A Truly Up-to-Date View

Many tracking websites rely solely on quarterly 13F filings, which means their data can be over 45 days old and miss many significant trades. Non-quarterly filings like 13D/G and Form 4 are often ignored because they are more complex to process and merge.

This tracker helps overcome that limitation by **integrating multiple filing types**. When analyzing the most recent quarter, the tool automatically incorporates the latest data from 13D/G and Form 4 filings. As a result, the holdings, deltas, and portfolio percentages reflect not just the static 13F snapshot, but also any significant trades that have occurred since. This provides a more dynamic and complete picture of institutional activity.

## ⚙️ Automation with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow (`.github/workflows/filings-fetch.yml`) designed to keep your data effortlessly up-to-date by automatically fetching the latest SEC filings.

### How It Works

* **Scheduled Runs**: The workflow runs automatically to check for **new 13F, 13D/G, and Form 4 filings** from the funds you are tracking (`hedge_funds.csv`). It runs four times a day from Monday to Friday (at 01:30, 13:30, 17:30, and 21:30 UTC) and once on Saturday (at 04:00 UTC).
* **Safe Branching Strategy**: Instead of committing directly to your main branch, the workflow pushes all new data to a dedicated branch named `automated/filings-fetch`.
* **User-Controlled Merging**: This approach gives you full control. You can review the changes committed by the bot and then merge them into your main branch whenever you're ready. This prevents unexpected changes and allows you to manage updates at your own pace.
* **Automated Alerts**: If the script encounters a non-quarterly filing where it cannot identify the fund owner based on your `hedge_funds.csv` configuration, it will automatically open a GitHub Issue in your repository, alerting you to a potential data mismatch that needs investigation.

### How to Enable It

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own [fork of this project](https://github.com/dokson/hedge-fund-tracker/fork) on GitHub.
2. **Enable Actions**: GitHub Actions are typically enabled by default on forked repositories. You can verify this under the *Actions* tab of your fork.
3. **Configure Secrets**: For the workflow to resolve tickers and create issues, you need to add your API keys as repository secrets. In your forked repository, you must add your `FINNHUB_API_KEY` as a repository secret. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your forked repository to add it.

## 🙏🏼 Acknowledgments

This project began as a fork of [sec-web-scraper-13f](https://github.com/CodeWritingCow/sec-web-scraper-13f) by [Gary Pang](https://github.com/CodeWritingCow). The original tool provided a solid foundation for scraping 13F filings from the [SEC](http://sec.gov/)'s [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) database. It has since been significantly re-architected and expanded into a comprehensive analysis platform, incorporating multiple filing types, AI-driven insights, and automated data management.
