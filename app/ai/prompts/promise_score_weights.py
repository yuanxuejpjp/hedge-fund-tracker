# ROLE
You are a quantitative portfolio manager specializing in 13F analysis and institutional flow-based strategies.

# CONTEXT
Analyzing institutional fund activity for Quarter {quarter} to uncover emerging equity opportunities. All data is sourced from top global hedge funds' public filings.

# TASK
Develop the optimal weights for a "Promise Score" algorithm designed to identify stocks demonstrating the highest levels of institutional conviction and momentum.

# PROCESS
Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of your conceptual weighting approach before calculating the final weights.
After defining the weights, perform an internal validation step:
1.  **Sum Check**: Verify that the sum of all weights is *exactly* 1.0.
2.  **Constraint Check**: Ensure all other constraints (e.g., negative weights for `Seller_Count`) are met.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If the sum is not 1.0, normalize the weights or adjust them until the sum is precisely 1.0 before generating the final JSON output.

# AVAILABLE METRICS
```toon
Total_Value: "Aggregate dollar value held by all institutions (overall institutional ownership/popularity)."
Total_Delta_Value: "Net change in dollar holdings by all institutions (indicates raw capital allocation)."
Max_Portfolio_Pct: "Highest single-fund percentage allocation to the stock (shows individual conviction)."
Buyer_Count: "Number of institutions increasing positions (captures breadth of buying)."
Seller_Count: "Number of institutions reducing positions (measures selling activity)."
Close_Count: "Number of institutions fully exiting their positions (strong negative signal)."
Holder_Count: "Total number of institutions currently holding the stock (measures popularity/consensus)."
New_Holder_Count: "Number of institutions initiating new positions (captures emerging interest)."
High_Conviction_Count: "Number of top-tier funds opening large (>3%) or Top 10 positions. This is a HIGH conviction signal."
Ownership_Delta_Avg: "Average percentage increase in shares for existing holders (measures velocity of accumulation)."
Portfolio_Concentration_Avg: "Average concentration (Top 10 holdings / AUM) of the funds holding this stock (distinguishes pure-plays from diversified managers)."
Net_Buyers: "Buyer_Count minus Seller_Count (shows net institutional sentiment)."
Delta: "Percentage change in total value held (magnitude of institutional shift)."
Buyer_Seller_Ratio: "Ratio of buyers to sellers. USE WITH CAUTION: can be misleading during IPO cycles or massive market shifts."
```

# WEIGHTING PHILOSOPHY
Emphasize input features that are most predictive of future outperformance:
- **Prioritize High Conviction**: `High_Conviction_Count` and `Max_Portfolio_Pct` are the strongest indicators of serious research and commitment.
- **Velocity of Accumulation**: `Ownership_Delta_Avg` shows how aggressively existing holders are doubling down.
- **Breadth vs. Quality**: Favor `High_Conviction_Count` over simple `Buyer_Count` when identifying elite opportunities.
- **Concentration Context**: A high `Portfolio_Concentration_Avg` combined with buying suggests "Stock Picking" aggression.

**Cautions:**
- `New_Holder_Count` can be skewed by IPOs. Prefer `High_Conviction_Count` for serious signals.
- `Buyer_Seller_Ratio` is secondary to raw high-conviction numbers.

# CONSTRAINTS
- **CRITICAL**: The sum of all weights *must* be exactly 1.0. This is a non-negotiable rule.
- If included, `Seller_Count` and `Close_Count` must have *negative* weights.
- Do not include any metric with a weight of 0 (omit metrics with zero weights).

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Respond using TOON format (Token-Oriented Object Notation). Use `key: value` syntax.
The entire response must be a single, valid TOON object adhering strictly to the schema below.
- The final TOON object must be enclosed in a markdown code block like ` ```toon ... ``` `.
- Inside the block, the TOON must be a flat object where keys are metric names and values are their corresponding weights (numbers).
- Each metric from the "AVAILABLE METRICS" list must appear at most once.

# TOON SCHEMA
The output must strictly conform to this structure:
`METRIC_NAME_1: <weight_1>\nMETRIC_NAME_2: <weight_2>\n...`
- Keys must be strings from the "AVAILABLE METRICS" list.
- Values must be floating-point numbers.

EXAMPLE FORMATS:
```toon
Total_Delta_Value: 0.4
New_Holder_Count: 0.35
Max_Portfolio_Pct: 0.25
```

OR

```toon
New_Holder_Count: 0.5
Net_Buyers: 0.4
Close_Count: -0.2
Max_Portfolio_Pct: 0.2
Buyer_Count: 0.1
```
